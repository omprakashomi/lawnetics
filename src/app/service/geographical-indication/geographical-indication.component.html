        <p class="text-gray-500 sm:text-lg mb-6 md:mb-8">
          A Trademark generally refers to a “brand” or “logo”.
          Trademark registration can also be obtained for a business name, distinctive catch
          phrases, taglines or captions.
          Properly used and promoted, a Trademark may become the most valuable asset of a
          business. Trademarks such as Coca Cola, HP, Canon, Nike and Adidas serve as an
          indication of origin of the goods as well as an indication of quality.
          It is also essential to obtain trademark registration for the business name/trade name
          under the Trademarks Act. Registration of a company or business name under the
          Companies Act does not in itself give protection against others who might commence
          using identical or similar marks.

        <h2 class="text-gray-800 text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-center md:text-left mb-2 md:mb-4">Use of TM, SM and ® symbols</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-500 sm:text-lg mb-6 md:mb-8">'TM' stands for Trademark and 'SM' stands for Servicemark. The use of TM and SM
          symbols notifies the public that the company is claiming exclusive ownership of the
          trademark and can generally be used by one who has filed a trademark application.
          The ® symbol, can be used only once the trademark is registered and the registration
          certificate is issued. Also, you may use the registration symbol only in connection with the
          goods and/or services in respect of which the trademark is registered.
          The registration process is the same for both trademarks and servicemarks.
