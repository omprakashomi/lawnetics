          Patents protect inventions and improvements to existing inventions.
Patent is a monopoly right granted by the Government to exclude others from
exploiting or using a particular invention. This exclusive monopoly granted by a
Patent is provided in return for the inventor disclosing the details of the invention to
the public. Therefore, the patent is a monopoly right which offers exclusivity to the
patentee to exploit the invention for 20 years after which it falls to the public
domain.
While filing a patent for your invention, there are several critical aspects to be
followed especially in drafting the claims, which define the scope of the invention.
Drafting patent specification is an art by itself, and requires the expertise of skilled
professionals in this field.

          <h5 class="text-gray-800 text-xl sm:text-xl font-semibold text-center md:text-left mb-2 md:mb-4">1. Provisional Application</h5>
        <p class="text-gray-500 sm:text-lg mb-6 md:mb-8">A provisional application is a temporary application which is filed when the invention is not
          finalized and is still under experimentation.
          Advantages of filing a provisional application:
          </p>
          <ul class="pl-8 text-gray-500 sm:text-lg mb-6 md:mb-8">
            <li>Applicant gets 12 months’ time to fully develop the invention and ascertain its market
              potential.</li>
            <li>Helps to establish “priority” right over the invention.</li>
            <li>Enables the applicant to use the term "patent pending” on their product.
            </li>
            <li>Less expensive to prepare and file the application.</li>
            <li>Enables the applicant to file International applications and claim priority within 12 
              months.</li>

          </ul>
          <p class="text-gray-500 sm:text-lg mb-6 md:mb-8">
            However, in order for the patent to be granted, a provisional application must be followed by
            a complete specification within 12 months. Moreover, the provisional application should be
            sufficiently detailed and must be drafted very carefully to ensure that the priority rights are
            secured for your invention.            
          </p>

          <h5 class="text-gray-800 text-xl sm:text-xl font-semibold text-center md:text-left mb-2 md:mb-4">2. Ordinary or Non-Provisional Application</h5>
          <p class="text-gray-500 sm:text-lg mb-6 md:mb-8">
            An application for patent filed in the Patent Office without claiming any priority of application made in
a convention country or without any reference to any other application under process in the office is
called an ordinary application. An ordinary application must be accompanied with a complete
specification and claims.          
          </p>

          <h5 class="text-gray-800 text-xl sm:text-xl font-semibold text-center md:text-left mb-2 md:mb-4">3. Convention Application</h5>
          <p class="text-gray-500 sm:text-lg mb-6 md:mb-8">
            An application for patent filed in the Patent Office, claiming a priority date based on the same or
            substantially similar application filed in one or more of the convention countries, is called a convention
            application. In order to get convention status, an applicant should file the application in the Indian
            Patent Office within 12 months from the date of first filing of a similar application in the convention
            country.       
          </p>

          <h5 class="text-gray-800 text-xl sm:text-xl font-semibold text-center md:text-left mb-2 md:mb-4">4. PCT International Application</h5>
          <p class="text-gray-500 sm:text-lg mb-6 md:mb-8">
            A PCT Application is an international application governed by the Patent Cooperation Treaty, and can
            be validated in upto 142 countries.
            Advantages of filing a PCT Application:
          </p>
          <ul class="pl-8 text-gray-500 sm:text-lg mb-6 md:mb-8">
            <li>A single international patent application can be filed in order to seek protection for an invention in
              up to 142 countries throughout the world.</li>
            <li>The priority date obtained by filing a PCT application is internationally recognized, and has an
              effect in each of the countries designated.
              </li>
            <li>It gives the application 30/31 months to enter into various countries from the international filing
              date or the priority date, and therefore gives the applicant more time to assess the viability of the
              invention.
            </li>
            <li>Delays the expenses associated with applying for a patent in various countries
              .</li>
            <li>Provides an International Search Report citing prior art, which gives an indication to the applicant
              whether the invention is novel and innovative.
            </li>
            <li>Provides an International Search Report citing prior art, which gives an indication to the applicant
              whether the invention is novel and innovative.</li>
              <li>Provides an option for requesting an International Preliminary Examination Report, the report
                containing an opinion on the patentability of the invention.</li>
                <li>The International Search Report and International Preliminary Examination Report, allows the
                  applicant to make more informed choices early in the patent process, and to amend the
                  application to deal with any conflicting material, before the major expenses of the national phase
                  of the patent process begin. It also gives the applicant a fair idea on the patentability of the
                  invention before incurring charges for filing and prosecuting the application in each country.</li>
